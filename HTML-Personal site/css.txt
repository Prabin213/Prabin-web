selector{property:value;}
selector are which style i want to change and property is what to change and value
in css for class and id -class can be used for several items but id should be unique for each item for styles
-----------------
in fontsize {em} can be used tochange the font size eg-5.625em
and {rem} is used because the rem doesnt change as per the body font size it remain same  where ever it has been used
